Once you get a local working copy downloaded to your machine the 2 most important operations are "Update" which will download the latest files from the repository, and "Commit..." which will send your changes to the server. You should see both options when right clicking on the project directory in windows explorer.

It is possible to lock a file if you REALLY don't want anyone else to touch it while you are working on it but that generally shouldn't be necessary.
